# MovieRecommender# Movie Recommender System

**Notebook:** `MovieRecommenderSystem.ipynb` (placed at `/mnt/data/MovieRecommenderSystem.ipynb`)

---

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook implements a **movie recommender system** and documents the full workflow: data loading and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model(s) training (collaborative filtering / matrix factorization / baseline or content-based — whichever is implemented in the notebook), evaluation, and producing recommendations. The notebook is organized for readability and reproducibility so you (or a reviewer) can run it end-to-end.

## Contents / Notebook Structure

1. **Introduction & goals** — high level description of what the notebook aims to do.
2. **Dependencies & environment setup** — packages required to run the notebook.
3. **Data loading** — instructions + code to load dataset(s) used (e.g., MovieLens or custom CSVs).
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** — summary statistics and plots to understand users, movies, and ratings.
5. **Preprocessing** — cleaning steps, encoding, train/test split, and matrix construction.
6. **Modeling** — implementation of one or more recommender algorithms (e.g., user-based CF, item-based CF, matrix factorization, SVD, or a baseline popularity model). May include hyperparameter tuning.
7. **Evaluation** — metrics such as RMSE, MAE, Precision@K, Recall@K, or NDCG, depending on task framing.
8. **Generating recommendations** — how to create top-N recommendations for a user or for all users.
9. **Results & discussion** — interpretation of results, strengths and limitations, and potential next steps.
10. **Appendix / Utilities** — helper functions, saving/loading models, example usage.

## Requirements

This notebook was developed and tested with a Python 3.8+ environment. Install dependencies with pip (example):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# If you don't have a requirements file, install the common packages:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn scipy matplotlib seaborn jupyterlightgbm surprise
```

> Note: Replace `surprise`, `lightgbm` with the actual libraries used in the notebook. If the notebook uses PyTorch or TensorFlow, install those as well.

## Data

The notebook expects a movie ratings dataset. If the repo does not include the dataset, you can download a common public dataset (MovieLens) using the URLs below, or replace with your custom data in CSV format.

- **MovieLens 100K**: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/
- **MovieLens 1M**: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/

**Data format (typical):**
- `ratings.csv` or `u.data`: userId, movieId, rating, timestamp
- `movies.csv`: movieId, title, genres

If your notebook references specific filenames, make sure to place them in the same folder or change the path in the data loading cell.

## How to run

1. Open the notebook in JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebook / VS Code Jupyter extension:

```bash
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook
```

2. Make sure the Python kernel has the environment with the packages installed.
3. Run cells sequentially (or restart kernel and run all). If any path/data errors appear, update the file path variables at the top of the notebook.

**Tip:** If you want to run the notebook programmatically and export the results, use `nbconvert`:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute MovieRecommenderSystem.ipynb --output executed.ipynb
```

---

## Expected outputs

- EDA plots showing rating distributions, popular movies, and active users.
- Trained model objects (in-memory or saved to disk) and evaluation scores (e.g., RMSE, Precision@K).
- A sample of top-N recommendations for example users printed in the notebook.

---

## Reproducibility

To reproduce results exactly, set random seeds where appropriate (e.g., `numpy.random.seed`, `random.seed`, and ML framework seeds). If the notebook uses train/test splits, note the seed and the split ratio in the preprocessing section.

---

## Customization & Next steps

You can extend the notebook by:
- Trying alternate models (matrix factorization, implicit-feedback approaches like Alternating Least Squares, neural recommenders).
- Adding content-based features (movie genres, tags, embeddings from plots or posters).
- Building an evaluation pipeline with cross-validation and time-aware splits for realistic recommendations.
- Deploying the model as a simple web service (Flask/FastAPI) or integrating with a Streamlit demo.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing packages:** install the required package using `pip` or `conda`.
- **Data file not found:** verify the file path at the top of the notebook and ensure the dataset is downloaded.
- **Kernel crashes / memory limits:** reduce dataset size (use a subset such as MovieLens 100K) or run on a machine with more RAM.

## Attribution

If you use this notebook in a report or public repository, please cite the original author(s) of the notebook and any datasets used (e.g., GroupLens for MovieLens).

If you want, I can:
- generate a `requirements.txt` automatically from imports in the notebook,
- create a minimal `environment.yml` for conda,
- or produce a short `Dockerfile` to run the notebook reproducibly.

Tell me which one you'd like next.
